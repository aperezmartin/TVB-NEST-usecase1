How to execute it ??

it needs 3 arguments,
- where your repo is cloned in the local folder
- where global_settings is located
- where action_plan is located

like this:
./setup.sh myforkedrepo ./test/XML/global_settings.xml  ./test/XML/mock_1_plan.xml 


Current state:
--------------
Fake apps are able to connect to HUB but the simulation protocol get stuck.
I reused Kim's work about MPI protocol between apps, but things don't work as expected. Some work is needed here.
Happy coding! :)
